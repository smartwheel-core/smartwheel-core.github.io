## Why do I need it?

The main problem with keyboard encoders and standalone dials is that there aren't many features out of the box, but they can be much, much more powerful than they are right now. Have you seen those techy gadgets from Hollywood blockbusters that hackers use (like Q's fancy joystick from latest 007)? Smartwheel gives you the same functionality, but adapted for day-to-day use.

Smartwheel is written in Python/PyQt6, so it could be easily modded with custom plugins. There aren't many right now, but this project is in constant development - there will be more soon.

## We need your help!

I've started working on this project a while ago, but it turned out that it's too big: it won't be possible to finish it without your help. However, it's much easier to implement features one-by-one: you only need basic Python3 (and sometimes PyQt6) knowledge. If you believe in this project and want to contribute, please DM me. Even small fixes, ideas or suggestions are very important.
